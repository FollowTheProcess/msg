## Project Description

When writing [pytoil] I discovered [ines/wasabi] and absolutely loved it immediately! Then when I started learning go and writing some CLI's I kept wishing I had it there too.

So here it is :tada:

Full credit goes to [fatih/color] for handling all the difficult colouring stuff for me and to [ines/wasabi] for the API design.
