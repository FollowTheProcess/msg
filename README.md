## Project Description

Who else is bored with boring grey text in CLIs? üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We all have fancy terminals, utf-8 is everywhere, no one is still using the stock windows command prompt any more... are they? ü§®

`msg` is a tiny toolkit to make rendering beautiful looking output from CLIs as easy as possible in Go.

It's so easy, you *already* know how it works!

## Installation

```shell
go get github.com/FollowTheProcess/msg@latest
```

## Quickstart

The demo screenshot at the top of the page will get you:

Not bad! üöÄ

## User Guide

`msg` has 5 message types:

* **Title** - Section header for a block of output
* **Info** - General info, status updates etc.
* **Success** - Your CLI has successfully done something
* **Warn** - Warn the user about something e.g. ignoring hidden files
* **Error** - Something has gone wrong in your application

All have a single trailing newline automatically applied except `Title` which has 1 leading and 2 trailing newlines to create separation.

```go
msg.Error("My error message, underlying error: %v", err) // Newlines are handled for you

// i.e. you don't need to do this
msg.Error("My error message, underlying error: %v\n", err)

// Titles are effectively "\n{your title}\n\n"
msg.Title("My title") // Is enough to get separation in sections of output
```

### Stdout/Stderr

By default, every function in `msg` prints to `os.Stdout` with the exception of `msg.Error` which prints to `os.Stderr`.

`msg` also exports "F-style" print functions which can write to any `io.Writer` e.g:

```go
buf := &bytes.Buffer{} // is an io.Writer

msg.Ferror(buf, "My error message")
```
